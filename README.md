# Self-Supervised-Learning-Using-Low-Data-Regime
This project explores self-supervised pretraining to enhance supervised learning in scenarios with limited labeled data.  

## Key Features:
- Uses **STL-10 dataset**
- **SimCLR with ResNet**
- Compared **ResNet, EfficientNet, and another CNN**
- Achieved **88% accuracy with EfficientNet**
- Plotted **epochs vs. loss/accuracy** graphs

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anirudh-programmer/Self-Supervised-Learning-Low-Data-Regime-.git
